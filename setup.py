### 6. **setup.py**

A basic setup file for packaging. This will need more details based on your project's requirements.

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='glueops-utility-library',
    version='0.1',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        # List your dependencies here
    ],
    entry_points={
        # If needed, you can add entry points for command line utilities here
    }
)
